[[[Checkpoint Bar1]]]
Branch A
- There was a bar...
    [Bar1: 5 seconds => +P, superinteract=> 1 second, +K1]
[1P] ...and whenever it filled, player got a point...
[3P] ...and when player got three points, they could buy an upgrade...
    [Buy upgrade 3P] => -Branch A +Branch B
[5P] ...but they did not rush to do that, waiting to see if there's a better upgrade available later...
[7P] ...and indeed there was one!
    [Buy better upgrade 7P] => -Branch A +Branch C
[8P] They decided to take a chance and wait for even better upgrade...
[10P] ...and at some moment, both upgrades were gone...
    [-both buttons]
[12P] ...so they waited to see, whether the new ones would show up...
[15P] ...but they never did. However, in this long journey player learned somehow that
    {Shift+Holding mouse button on the bar or touching it with two fingers makes it fill a lot faster! [use=+K1]}

Ending : Knowledge 1

Branch B
    [Bar1: loop over itself => F]
- At first, nothing changed. Bar did not get faster and nothing new appeared...
[1F] ...but then the bar filled and instead of giving a point started filling anew...
[1F +5P] [Fix the upgrade 5P] => -Branch B +Branch D
[2F] ...and again...
[3F] ...and again...
[5F -5P] ...and player never got a point to unlock anything anymore.

Ending : Empty 1

Branch C
    [Bar2 : 100 => +B2, dx = B1]
- The new bar appeared that would fill in an irregular manner...
[2P]...that seemed to depend on how much of the first bar is filled...
[3P+K1]...and even mysterious knowledge would not really help speed it up by a lot...
[B2] ...and when the new bar finally filled, the next bar appeared...
    [Bar3: 1000 => +B3, dx = Bar1 * Bar2]
[2B2 -B3] ...dependendent on both previous bars...
[B3] ...and when the new bar finally filled, the next bar appeared...
    [Bar4: 10000 => +B4, dx = Bar1 * Bar2 * Bar3]
[B4] ...and that would keep going. But at least player learned that
    {getting first upgrade with at least 5 spare points might be a good idea [+K2]}
    [Bar5: 100000 => +B4, dx = Bar1 * Bar2 * Bar3 * Bar4]

Ending : Knowledge 2

Branch D
    [Bar1: 5 seconds => random(water, food), cap 5 each]
- Now the bar would fill properly and give...
[F -W] ...Food?..
    [Eat food *F] => Player ate all the food.[+EF]
[W -F] ...Water?..
    [Drink water *W] => Player drank all the water [+EW]
[F +W] ...and Food?..
[W +F] ...and Water?..
[EF EW]
    ...and only after that waste of resources were they allowed to collect wood.
    [Collect wood: 5 seconds +WD, cap 5]
[[[Checkpoint 2W2F]]]
[2W 2F] As they suspected, player soon were able to hire a worker...
    [Hire a worker 1F1W] => Branch E
[4W 4F]
    ...but they decided they did not want to waste food and water on a freeloader...
[5W 5F]
    ...and by the time they would finally be able to build a warehouse, nobody wanted to work for them already...

Ending : Empty 2

Brahcn E
    [worker : -0.3F/s, -0.3W/s, faster than production]
    ...but all they would do is eat and drink...
[3WD?]
    ...until player finally could build a warehouse to store more food, wood and water!..
    [Build a warehouse 3WD]
[-(EF EW)]
    ...but they did not have materials to do so.
